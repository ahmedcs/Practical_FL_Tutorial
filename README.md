# Abstract
Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across a multitude of edge devices, such as mobile phones and IoT systems, while preserving user privacy. As the proliferation of edge computing intersects with stringent data privacy regulations, FL provides an innovative solution to leverage the wealth of data generated at the network edge. However, real-world deployment presents unique challenges, including heterogeneous data distributions, varying computational and communication resources, dynamic device availability, and the need for cross-platform implementations. This tutorial offers a systematic introduction to theoretical insights, practical system design, and implementation strategies for FL at the wireless network edge. Key topics include convergence analysis for arbitrary client participation, cost-effective system parameter design, adaptive client sampling, incentive mechanisms, and defense strategies against malicious actors. Participants will gain actionable insights into addressing challenges like system and statistical heterogeneity, communication and computation constraints, and client availability dynamics. By combining theoretical foundations, economic incentive mechanisms, and real-world case studies-including cross-platform implementations and campus-wide applications-this tutorial provides a comprehensive framework for developing and deploying robust FL systems. It addresses key challenges and unlocks the potential of machine learning in edge computing, offering valuable perspectives to advance the field and inspire practical innovations.

### Hands on Robust FL-based Intrusion Detection System 
In the context of network security, FL can be used to collaboratively train Intrusion Detection System (IDS) models across multiple organizations, virtually extending the local dataset of each participant. Among the new challenges raised by this approach, the heterogeneity of the clientsâ€™ environments induce consequent differences in the data distributions, and therefore contributions. Further, identifying and mitigating malicious contributions is made more complex in heterogeneous environments.  This hands-on introduces the audience to the principles of FL and its application to network security, and more specifically to build Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDSs) using FL. We cover the issues raised by using FL in the context of network security, with a particular focus on poisoning attacks.

## Part1-2 Content Outline

**Mechanism design and deployment strategies for fL at the edge.**
Dr. Bing Luo will talk about how to achieve cost-effective FL deployment at network edge via flexible client sampling and incentive mechanism for randomized client participation. Specifically, he will present recent advanced client sampling strategies for minimizing the FL convergence time in edge networks by jointly considering system heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity. He will then present a few game-theoretic incentive mechanisms for FL to deal with randomized client participation, which designs a customized pricing strategy to motivate different clients to join with different participation levels for achieving an unbiased and high-performance model.

## Part2-1 Content Outline

1. FL for collaborative security.
2. Security of FL architectures.
   
In this hands-on part, participants will be using [Flower](https://flower.ai/), an open-source framework for FL in Python, and an existing datasets for training an FL model for IDS task.

**FL for collaborative security.**
We will exmaine the application of FL to network security, and more specifically to the training of Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDS) models.
The hands-on will consist of building a simple CIDS model using Flower and a dataset of network traffic, and experiment some of these challenges with toy examples.

**Security in collaborative FL.** 
Then, we will examine some challenges of deploying and running Federated Intrusion Detection Systems (FIDSs). Depending on the nature of the federation (public or private, trustworthiness of the participants, *etc.*), such systems can be vulnerable to various attacks. In particular, we will focus on poisoning attacks, where a participant tries to degrade the global model by sending malicious contributions, before discussing possible countermeasures. The hands-on will consist of simulating a poisoning attack on the CIDS model built in the previous part, and experimenting with strategies to detect and mitigate such attacks.

## Part2-2 Content Outline

**Cross-platform FL implementation and real-world applications.**
The tutorial will conclude by demonstrating a cross-platform FL implementation for Android and iOS, and a real-world mobile edge FL launch at university campus as shown below figure. Challenges and future directions will be discussed.

## Materials

Part2-1 hands-on tutorial runs in this [notebook](notebooks/Attack_FL_IDS.ipynb) which if you open it you will find a link that opens it directly in Google Colab, however, if you prefer to have a standalone setup, please use the below tools.  

### Installation

To have standalone setup, this part uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for Python dependencies management, and [Nix](https://nixos.org) for system dependencies management.

If you are a Nix user, the easiest way to install the dependencies is to use the provided `flake.nix` file, which will create a virtual environment with all the necessary dependencies, including the Python ones.
To do so, simply run the following command from anywhere inside the repository, and open the Jupyter notebooks from the generated shell session.
```bash
nix develop
```

If you are not a Nix user, you can still use Poetry to install the Python dependencies.
To do so, run the following command at the root of the respository.
```bash
poetry install
```
You can then use the genserated virtual environment to run the notebooks.
If not, you can open a shell session using `poetry shell` and run `jupyter notebook` from there.
